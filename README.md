# TinyWL Clone

This project is a hand-written clone of [TinyWL](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/tree/master/tinywl) (CC0). The primary objective of this exercise is for me to understand how wayland works (so I can finally get back to [spatial-wl](https://www.github.com/preyneyv/spatial-wl)!)
