# TinyWL Clone

This project is a hand-written clone of [TinyWL](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/tree/master/tinywl) (CC0). The primary objective of this exercise is for me to understand how wayland works (so I can finally get back to [spatial-wl](https://www.github.com/preyneyv/spatial-wl)!)


## Running It

You'll need a copy of wlroots-0.19 built and set up. Modify the paths in `Makefile` to match where you have it installed to, then simply run `make run`

```
